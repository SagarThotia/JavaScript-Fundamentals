# DOM Manipulation


## Window Object

The window object represents an open window in a browser. It is browser's object(not Javascript's) & is automatically created by browser.

It is a global object with lots of properties and methods. 

### What is DOM?

When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model (DOM) on the page.
